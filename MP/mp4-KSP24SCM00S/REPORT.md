## Summary and Reflection

This app lets users create flashcard decks, load sample data from JSON, and take quizzes with shuffled cards. It uses SQLite for data storage and SharedPreferences for one time JSON loading. The UI is responsive and organized with separate files for views, models, services, and widgets. All required features, including sorting and quiz progress tracking, are implemented.

This project was a good way to apply everything I learned in class. It brought together different parts like navigation, layouts, data persistence, and state management into one app. Using Flutter with SQLite was interesting, and with the help of class demos and explanations from the professor, building the app felt straightforward and enjoyable.
