## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Tick the boxes (i.e., fill them with 'X's) that apply to your submission:

- [X] The app builds without error

      that apply):
  - [X] iOS simulator / MacOS
  - [ ] Android emulator
- [X] Users can register and log in to the server via the app
- [X] Session management works correctly; i.e., the user stays logged in after

      and completed games), and can be manually refreshed
- [X] A game can be started correctly (by placing ships, and sending an
      appropriate request to the server)

## Summary and Reflection

MP5 "Battleship" allowed me to apply many of the concepts I learned in class. The examples and demos from lectures were especially helpful in guiding me through tasks like handling user login information and updating the game screen effectively.

I enjoyed designing the Battleship grid and customizing its appearance with different colors to make it feel closer to the original game. This not only improved the overall look of the interface but also made the gameplay clearer and easier to follow. Overall this project helped me understand key concepts of Flutter and client server communication. Before this assignment, I wasn’t entirely confident in building complete applications, but now I feel much more capable of developing functional and visually appealing apps. It was a great opportunity to put everything we’ve learned in class into a working, practical application. All the previous machine problems contributed toward building this Battleship project, which was quite a large and comprehensive task in the end.
