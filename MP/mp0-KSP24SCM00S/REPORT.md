## Summary and Reflection

I successfully completed all the steps and uploaded the updated REPORT.md file to GitHub. I confirmed that everything was submitted correctly by checking the repository and seeing my commit and changes.

This MP was helpful in showing how to use VSCode and GitHub Classroom for future assignments. At first, I was a bit confused about how to push my changes, but after trying it out, it started to make sense.
