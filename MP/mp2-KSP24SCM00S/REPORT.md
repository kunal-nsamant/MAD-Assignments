## Summary and Reflection

I built a profile app that shows my personal info, contact details, education, and projects. I made separate classes for UserInfo and ProjectInfo to keep the data organized. The app has a blue theme and uses cards for each section to make it look clean. 

The hardest part was getting the layout right with all the rows and columns nested inside each other. Arranging the boxes, colors, and making the scrollable parts work was mostly trial and error - I had to keep tweaking things until they looked right. I also had to add error handling for when images don't load properly. I made reusable widgets like SectionCard and ContactRow so I didn't have to repeat code.

I enjoyed working with Flutter's widgets and seeing how they fit together.The project helped me understand how Flutter layouts work and how to structure an app properly.
